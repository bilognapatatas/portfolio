      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        I am Raiah Crista Ucol, a first year IT student at the University of the Cordilleras majoring in Network and Security. When I was a child, I envisioned my life to be filled with languages concerning the diverse linguistics of humans but to my surprise, I did land on languages but is for computers. So, here I am studying information technology to make the world a better place as the world progresses with technological advancements.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I was a child, I wondered which path was right for me. After much deliberation that took me years on deciding, I chose to study information technology. This chosen course of mine made me realize my potential and capabilities regarding technology. I have learned many interesting concepts in my first semester as an IT student. The learning given to me by my instructors definitely expanded my prior knowledge about how computers, systems, and different programming languages serve crucial purposes in our daily lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        My developing understanding about my field creates an environment of constant improvement, coding is starting to become second nature to me and the complexities of this course is constantly challenging me to strive for excellence that will be important in building my future as an IT professional.
      </p>

      <p>
        What they say is true, information technology really is a difficult course to understand but it serves as my motivation as I build myself towards success one code at a time. My life is like a code, what I am doing now in my first year of college is the very foundation whether the outcome of my future is successful.
      </p>

      <p>
        With honest learning, efforts, and constant improvements, in time all of these hardships will be rewarded with my degree and diploma in which I will finally succeed as an IT professional.
